# markdownlint hook selects `types: [markdown]` and `identify` tags .mdx as `mdx`;
# Super-Linter v8.7.0 routes only the `md` extension into MARKDOWN and
# NATURAL_LANGUAGE. So a repository whose documentation is .mdx — mcn's docs/en is
# 100% .mdx — passes both gates without either having opened a file.
